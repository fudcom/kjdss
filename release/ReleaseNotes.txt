Release Notes KJDSS v1.3.0 (January 2010)
--------------------------

*** New Stuff and Changes

- Added 'calculateFrequencyTable' to KJFFT class to create a frequency table (in hertz) that correlates to the bands of the FFT output data.
- Improved 'BandDistribution' interface of KJScopeAndSpectrumAnalyser to be more closely coupled to the FFT instance. 
- The KJScopeAndSpectrumAnalyser band distribution table now includes the frequency range (in hertz) for each visible band of the spectrum analyser.
- Added customizable 'BandGain' interface to KJScopeAndSpectrumAnalyser which can apply different levels of gain to each band of FFT output data. 
- Improved look of and added options to scope, spectrum analyser and, volume meter. 
	- Spectrum analyser can now render the frequency of each band.
	- Spectrum analyser is using the new BandGain function to 'boost' the high frequencies for a more pleasing display.
	- Spectrum analyser bars are now spaced evenly no matter the size. 
	- Volume meter is more accurate and is channel aware. Displays 1 bar for mono, and 2 for stereo.
- KJScopeAndSpectrumAnalyser class is no longer supported by earlier versions of KJDSS (or KJDSP).

*** Fixes

- Data normaliser used by spectrum analyser supports more PCM raw audio data formats. Still some unsupported formats though (big-endian, unsigned)
- 8 bit audio data was trashed by the data normalizer due to a signed/unsigned conversion error. Caused incorrectly normalized audio data to be pass to the DSP components.


Release Notes KJDSS v1.2.2 (December 2009)
--------------------------

*** Fixes

- Fix a logic bug that caused clicks during playback when using KJDSS with source data line writing enabled. (Thanks Jeroen)


Release Notes KJDSS v1.2.1 (May 2009)
--------------------------

*** Changes

- Added functionality to modify the band distribution of the spectrum analyzer. See KJScopeAndSpectrumAnalyzer$BandDistribution class.
- Added option to prevent the KJDigitalSignalSynchronizer from writing to the source data line. See KJDigitalSignalSynchronizer.setSourceDateLineWriteEnabled().
- Default spectrum analyzer gain adjusted to 3.0
- KJScopeAndSpectrumAnalyzer class can now be easily extended and customized. Opened up many private methods and fields.

*** Fixes

- Fixed band distribution of sub-sonic bands. The first band more accurately displays bass drums and other low frequency sounds.
- Minor performance improvements.
- Sample program displays directories in the file chooser.


Release Notes KJDSS v1.2 (February 2009)
------------------------

*** Changes

- Package renamed to KJ Digital Signal Synchronizer (KJDSS) instead of KJ Digitial Signal Processor (KJ DSP)
- Java package hierarchy changes. ( kjdss )
- API changes to KJDigitalSignalProcessor, please update existing processors.
- Separated core KJ classes from KJ DSS and therefore KJDigitalSignalAudioDataConsumer is now renamed to KJDigitalSignalSynchronizer.
- Moved all spectrum analyser fine tuning code into the KJScopeAndSpectrumAnalyser (and out of KJFFT)
- Automatically calculate sample size for FPS and audio format.
- Provided direct access to DSS data buffer and other information from within a DSP via the KJDigitalSignalSynchronizer.Context object.
- Removed default sample processing into float[] channels.
- Added sample class to demo the KJDSS and KJScopeAndSpectrumAnalyser component

*** Fixes

- Fixed FFT calculation to prevent feed back at higher frequencies.
- Fixed FFT class to handle difference sample sizes properly.
- Fixed spectrum analyser band merging and averaging calculations. 5 band output looks roughly the same as 20 band or 120 band etc. )
- Applied Log band distribution to spectrum analyser for band merging. This spreads the lower frequency bands out wider for a nicer view of human voices in the spectrum.  
- Applied proper Log band gain spectrum analyser. Applies a Log multiplier to each band to "boost" the higher frequency bands, which generate a more uniform spectrum analyser output.
- Fixed GUI deadlocks with KJScopeAndSpectrumAnalyser component.
- Fixed buffer overflow problems when writing large amounts of audio data ( > 256kb ) to the DSS.
